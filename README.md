<p><em>3 Years of Experience Delivering Scalable Infrastructure |Backend & Systems Engineer. I’m a software engineer driven by curiosity and a love for building systems that solve real problems - from resilient backend architectures to secure low-level tools. My experience spans multiple domains: I’ve deployed scalable microservices in Spring Boot, engineered event replay systems with Kafka, automated cloud pipelines with AWS and Terraform, and implemented consensus protocols in C++. I’ve worked with everything from Java and Python to Go and Rust, choosing the right tool for the task, whether it’s cloud automation or systems-level programming. I thrive at the intersection of reliability and innovation - where engineering meets scale. Whether I’m collaborating on a team or deep in code, I care about clean abstractions, thoughtful design, and continuous learning. <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">
